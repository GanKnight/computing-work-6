ðŸ§ª Mr Ong Jokes ðŸ§ª

I think
I have understood what i means to be N2 about Science
I told more chemistry jokes 
But there seems to be no reaction
I tried telling them one about sodium
But they said NaBro
Is it because all the jokes ARGON?
To dilute my sorrows, 
I filtered my mistakes 
Boiled my ego
Obtaining a decomposed solution
At that moment, I felt like a DJ **BOBS TO BEAT OF KAHOOT**
I wonder if there is an element of confusion (Um) that can be named Adrianium one dayâ€¦ (Or was it because I trusted an atomâ€¦?)
